## Hi, I'm Evan

I’m a technology problem solver. Whether you are a small business needing to modernize your systems or a federal contractor navigating complex compliance requirements, I bring the same level of rigor and reliability to every project.

With over a decade of experience, I bridge the gap between enterprise-grade engineering and the practical realities of running a business. I don't just build technology; I build solutions that work for *you*.

## My Philosophy

Technology shouldn’t be a black box. It should be a transparent, reliable, and powerful asset for your business.

**I believe in Practical Engineering.**
I don’t chase trends. I focus on systems that work reliably in production. Whether it's automation, proper monitoring, or disaster recovery, I build things to last.

**I understand the Business Side.**
I’ve been an IT Director for a startup. I’ve managed a P&L, navigated technical debt, and led organizational change. I understand that every technical decision has a business cost and a business benefit.

**I deliver Complete Solutions.**
I don't just advise and walk away. From initial architecture through deployment and ongoing support, I get my hands dirty and ensure the system works as promised.

## Bringing Enterprise Experience to Your Business

I’ve spent years solving hard problems for massive organizations, and I apply those same lessons to every client I work with.

**Reliability & Security (Oracle)**
As a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at **Oracle**, I worked on systems that simply *could not fail*. I secured critical data exchange platforms ensuring they met strict NSA requirements. I bring this same security-first mindset to protecting your business assets.

**Efficiency & Automation (Sonatype)**
Time is money. At **Sonatype**, I helped engineer a process that reduced a critical data distribution task from **7 days to just 6.5 hours**. That’s the power of smart automation. I look for these opportunities in every business—finding the bottlenecks and crushing them.

**Business Leadership (DeCroix Services)**
I know what it’s like to sit in the driver’s seat. As **IT Director** for a 30-person startup, I successfully managed a $9.6M ARR operation. I led the charge to modernize 40 years of accumulated technical debt, moving from on-premise legacy systems to the cloud. I understand the pressure of making payroll and the need for technology to drive ROI, not just look cool.

**Field-Tested Engineering (Defense & Aviation)**
I’ve built systems that fly in helicopters and integrate with Navy simulations. At **Alion** and **Tek Fusion**, I learned that "deployment" means it has to work in the field, often under difficult conditions. I design with the real world in mind.

## Certifications
