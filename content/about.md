## Hi, I'm Evan

I’m a technology problem solver. Whether you are a small business needing to modernize your systems or a federal contractor navigating complex compliance requirements, I bring the same level of rigor and reliability to every project.

With over a decade of experience, I bridge the gap between enterprise-grade engineering and the practical realities of running a business. I don't just build technology; I build solutions that work for *you*.

## My Philosophy
 
 Technology shouldn’t be a bureaucratic hurdle. It needs to be a secure, reliable foundation for your mission.
 
 **I believe in Security by Design.**
 We don't just "bolt on" security at the end to pass an audit. I build systems that are secure from the ground up, making compliance easier to maintain long-term.
 
 **I understand the Small Business Struggle.**
 As a former IT Director for a 30-person company, I know what it's like to balance a limited budget with high expectations. You don't have infinite resources, so every dollar you spend on IT needs to deliver value and protection.
 
 **I deliver Complete Solutions.**
 I don't just hand you a stack of paperwork and wish you luck with the audit. I implement the controls, configure the firewalls, and ensure your systems actually meet the standards we claim they do.
 
 ## Real-World Defense Experience
 
 I’ve spent years solving hard problems for the DoD and enterprise organizations, and I apply those same lessons to small defense contractors.
 
 **Defense & Aviation Engineering (Alion / Tek Fusion)**
 I’ve built systems that fly in helicopters and integrate with Navy simulations. I understand that "deployment" means it has to work in the field, often under difficult conditions. I bring this same rigor to ensuring your compliance posture is mission-ready, not just paper-thin.
 
 **Reliability & Security (Oracle)**
 As a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at **Oracle**, I worked on systems that simply *could not fail*. I secured critical data exchange platforms ensuring they met strict NSA requirements. This security-first mindset is critical for protecting CUI.
 
 **Business & Operations (DeCroix Services)**
 As **IT Director**, I led the charge to modernize 40 years of accumulated technical debt. I managed a P&L, navigated audits, and led organizational change. I understand the pressure of making payroll and the need for technology to protect the business without bankrupting it.
 
 **Efficiency & Automation (Sonatype)**
 Compliance shouldn't require an army of people. At **Sonatype**, I helped engineer processes that drastically reduced manual effort through smart automation. I look for these opportunities to streamline your compliance evidence collection and reporting.
