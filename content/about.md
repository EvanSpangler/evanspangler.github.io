## Delivering Reliable Technology Solutions

Evan Spangler Consulting provides comprehensive IT and technology solutions for organizations with complex requirements. With nearly a decade of experience across federal, startup, and enterprise environments, we deliver everything from cloud infrastructure to custom embedded systems.

## Our Approach

Technology challenges vary dramatically across organizations. What works in a federal environment differs from startup needs, and enterprise solutions don't always fit specialized requirements. We draw from diverse experience to match solutions to your actual needs.

**Complete Solutions** - We don't just advise, we implement. From initial architecture through deployment and ongoing support, we deliver working systems.

**Proven Expertise** - Background includes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure cross-domain solutions, Navy simulation systems integration, military aviation embedded systems, and enterprise technology transformation.

**Practical Engineering** - Focus on systems that work reliably in production. Infrastructure-as-Code, automation, proper monitoring, and realistic disaster recovery.

**Diverse Capabilities** - Cloud infrastructure, custom electronics, physical security systems, DevOps automation, compliance implementation, and systems integration. We solve varied technical problems.

## Experience That Delivers

Our background spans multiple technology domains and organizational types:

**Cloud & Infrastructure** - Architected and implemented Oracle Cloud Infrastructure solutions, AWS deployments, and hybrid environments. Deep experience with Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform), automation (Ansible, Python), and CI/CD pipelines.

**Systems Integration** - Led integration of Live, Virtual, and Constructive simulation technologies for Navy training environments. Project management and technical integration of complex distributed systems.

**Custom Systems** - Designed and deployed embedded systems for military rotary-wing aviation, including hypervisor-based mission networking. Custom electronics for specialized applications.

**Security & Compliance** - CMMC Level 1 self-attestation engagement with IonDesign. Implemented enterprise-wide NIST 800-171 compliance as ISO/ISSO. Cross-domain solutions meeting NSA requirements.

**Enterprise Technology** - Directed $9.6M ARR technology operations, led cloud migrations, replaced legacy systems, and established modern IT processes.

**DevOps & Automation** - Reduced critical data distribution time from 7 days to 6.5 hours through parallelization. Built CI/CD pipelines, automated deployments, and infrastructure automation.
