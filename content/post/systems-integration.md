description: "Complex systems integration and project management. Experience includes Navy LVC simulation systems and distributed training environments."

Integrating complex systems requires both technical expertise and project management. We handle the coordination and technical work to make disparate systems work together.

Background includes integrating Live, Virtual, and Constructive simulation technologies for Navy training environments, managing integrated project teams across networks and software development, and bridging multiple Navy test ranges.

From planning through implementation, we deliver integrated solutions that function reliably in production environments.
