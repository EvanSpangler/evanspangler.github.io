## CMMC Compliance for Defense Contractors

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program is mandatory for defense contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). We help organizations achieve and maintain compliance efficiently.

## What is CMMC?

CMMC is the Department of Defense's unified cybersecurity standard for the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). It ensures contractors protect sensitive government information by implementing appropriate security controls.

**Three Levels:**
- **Level 1** - Foundational cybersecurity hygiene (17 practices)
- **Level 2** - Advanced cybersecurity practices aligned with NIST 800-171 (110 practices)
- **Level 3** - Expert-level practices for highly sensitive programs

Most contractors need Level 1 or Level 2 certification to continue bidding on DoD contracts.

## Our CMMC Services

### Readiness Assessment

Before pursuing certification, understand where you stand.

- **Scope Determination** - Identify which systems handle CUI and establish your CMMC boundary
- **Current State Analysis** - Evaluate existing security controls against CMMC requirements
- **Gap Identification** - Document specific areas needing remediation
- **Cost Estimation** - Realistic budgeting for compliance implementation

### Gap Analysis & Remediation Planning

Turn assessment findings into actionable steps.

- Detailed gap analysis mapping current controls to CMMC practices
- Prioritized remediation roadmap based on risk and certification timeline
- Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) development
- Resource requirements and implementation timeline

### Implementation Support

We guide you through the technical work of achieving compliance.

- Security control implementation
- System Security Plan (SSP) development
- Policy and procedure documentation
- Network segmentation and access controls
- Encryption and data protection measures
- Incident response plan development

### Level 1 Self-Attestation

For organizations requiring CMMC Level 1, we support the self-attestation process.

- Verification of all 17 Level 1 practices
- Documentation review and preparation
- Self-attestation submission guidance
- Annual reassessment support

### Level 2 Preparation

Preparing for third-party assessment requires thorough readiness.

- Full NIST 800-171 compliance validation
- Assessment scope documentation
- Evidence collection and organization
- Pre-assessment readiness review
- Remediation of identified issues before official assessment

## Recent Engagement: IonDesign CMMC Level 1

Successfully completed comprehensive CMMC Level 1 self-attestation engagement including:

- Complete scope assessment establishing CMMC boundaries
- Gap analysis identifying compliance requirements
- POA&M development for remediation tracking
- Full implementation of required security controls
- Documentation and attestation preparation

This engagement demonstrates our capability to guide organizations from initial assessment through successful attestation.

## Why CMMC Compliance Matters

**Contract Requirements** - Many DoD contracts now require CMMC certification before award.

**Supply Chain Impact** - Prime contractors increasingly require subcontractors to be certified.

**Competitive Advantage** - Early certification positions you favorably for contract opportunities.

**Better Security** - CMMC implementation genuinely improves your security posture, protecting both government and proprietary information.

## Common Challenges We Address

**Budget Constraints** - Small contractors often struggle with compliance costs. We help prioritize spending and identify cost-effective solutions.

**Technical Complexity** - NIST 800-171 and CMMC requirements can be overwhelming. We translate requirements into practical implementation steps.

**Resource Limitations** - Without dedicated IT staff, compliance seems impossible. We provide the expertise you're missing.

**Timeline Pressure** - Contract deadlines don't wait. We develop realistic timelines and help you move quickly without cutting corners.

## CMMC Compliance Process

1. **Initial Consultation** - Discuss your contracts, timeline, and current security posture
2. **Scope Assessment** - Determine your CMMC boundary and required level
3. **Gap Analysis** - Identify what needs to change to meet requirements
4. **Remediation Planning** - Create prioritized roadmap with realistic timelines
5. **Implementation** - Execute security controls and documentation
6. **Verification** - Validate all practices are properly implemented
7. **Certification** - Support through self-attestation or C3PAO assessment
8. **Ongoing Compliance** - Annual monitoring and updates as requirements evolve

## Investment & Timeline

Compliance costs vary based on your current security posture, organization size, and required CMMC level. After an initial consultation, we provide:

- Fixed-price quotes for assessment and planning phases
- Transparent implementation cost estimates
- Flexible engagement models (project-based or ongoing support)

**Typical Timelines:**
- Level 1 Self-Attestation: 2-4 months from start to completion
- Level 2 Preparation: 6-12 months depending on starting point
