<h2 id="hi-im-evan">Hi, I&rsquo;m Evan</h2>
<p>I’m a technology problem solver. Whether you are a small business needing to modernize your systems or a federal contractor navigating complex compliance requirements, I bring the same level of rigor and reliability to every project.</p>
<p>With over a decade of experience, I bridge the gap between enterprise-grade engineering and the practical realities of running a business. I don&rsquo;t just build technology; I build solutions that work for <em>you</em>.</p>
<h2 id="my-philosophy">My Philosophy</h2>
<p>Technology shouldn’t be a bureaucratic hurdle. It needs to be a secure, reliable foundation for your mission.</p>
<p><strong>I believe in Security by Design.</strong>
We don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;bolt on&rdquo; security at the end to pass an audit. I build systems that are secure from the ground up, making compliance easier to maintain long-term.</p>
<p><strong>I understand the Small Business Struggle.</strong>
As a former IT Director for a 30-person company, I know what it&rsquo;s like to balance a limited budget with high expectations. You don&rsquo;t have infinite resources, so every dollar you spend on IT needs to deliver value and protection.</p>
<p><strong>I deliver Complete Solutions.</strong>
I don&rsquo;t just hand you a stack of paperwork and wish you luck with the audit. I implement the controls, configure the firewalls, and ensure your systems actually meet the standards we claim they do.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-defense-experience">Real-World Defense Experience</h2>
<p>I’ve spent years solving hard problems for the DoD and enterprise organizations, and I apply those same lessons to small defense contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Defense &amp; Aviation Engineering (Alion / Tek Fusion)</strong>
I’ve built systems that fly in helicopters and integrate with Navy simulations. I understand that &ldquo;deployment&rdquo; means it has to work in the field, often under difficult conditions. I bring this same rigor to ensuring your compliance posture is mission-ready, not just paper-thin.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability &amp; Security (Oracle)</strong>
As a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at <strong>Oracle</strong>, I worked on systems that simply <em>could not fail</em>. I secured critical data exchange platforms ensuring they met strict NSA requirements. This security-first mindset is critical for protecting CUI.</p>
<p><strong>Business &amp; Operations (DeCroix Services)</strong>
As <strong>IT Director</strong>, I led the charge to modernize 40 years of accumulated technical debt. I managed a P&amp;L, navigated audits, and led organizational change. I understand the pressure of making payroll and the need for technology to protect the business without bankrupting it.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency &amp; Automation (Sonatype)</strong>
Compliance shouldn&rsquo;t require an army of people. At <strong>Sonatype</strong>, I helped engineer processes that drastically reduced manual effort through smart automation. I look for these opportunities to streamline your compliance evidence collection and reporting.</p>
<h2 id="certifications">Certifications</h2>
<p>My background includes professional certifications across cloud architecture, systems design, and networking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Certified DevOps Professional</li>
<li>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Certified Architect Associate</li>
<li>Systems Design Certificate, Cornell University</li>
<li>COMPTIA Linux+, Security+, Network+, A+</li>
<li>Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-i-can-help-you">How I Can Help You</h2>
<h3 id="modernizing-your-infrastructure">modernizing Your Infrastructure</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cloud migrations (AWS, OCI, Hybrid)</li>
<li>High-availability systems</li>
<li>Network redesigns</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="securing-your-business">Securing Your Business</h3>

<li>Security assessments</li>
<li>Physical security systems (cameras, access control)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-custom-solutions">Building Custom Solutions</h3>

<li>Industrial controls</li>
<li>Purpose-built hardware</li>

<li>Automated testing &amp; deployment</li>
<li>configuration management</li>
</ul>
