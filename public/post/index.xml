      <description>Your infrastructure is the foundation of your compliance posture. We design and build secure CMMC enclaves that isolate CUI from the rest of your network.&#xA;Using Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Ansible), we deploy compliant architectures with proper encryption, access controls, and boundary protection baked in.&#xA;Experience with AWS GovCloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and hybrid environments ensures your data stays safe and your hosting meets FedRAMP requirements.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t need a full-time CIO or CISO to be secure. We provide fractional IT leadership and support tailored to small defense contractors.&#xA;We handle day-to-day helpdesk needs, server administration, and security updates while maintaining the documentation required for CMMC.&#xA;Stop worrying about whether your admin is logging the right events or if your backups are encrypted. We handle the technical details so you can focus on fulfilling your contracts.</description>

      <description>Defense contractors face mandatory CMMC certification. We provide end-to-end support from initial assessment through successful certification.&#xA;Recent successful Level 1 attestation with IonDesign included scope assessment, gap analysis, POA&amp;amp;M development, and implementation. Experience also includes enterprise-wide NIST 800-171 implementation as ISO/ISSO.&#xA;Whether Level 1 self-attestation or Level 2 preparation, we guide organizations through compliance requirements efficiently. For a more comprehensive overview, please visit our CMMC Compliance page.</description>

      <description>Manual compliance is expensive and error-prone. We use DevOps principles to automate your security governance.&#xA;By implementing configuration management and continuous monitoring, we ensure that your systems stay compliant, not just during an audit window.&#xA;We build pipelines that automatically validate security controls, enforce secure baselines, and generate the evidence you need for your System Security Plan (SSP).</description>
