      <description>Defense contractors face mandatory CMMC certification. We provide end-to-end support from initial assessment through successful certification.&#xA;Recent successful Level 1 attestation with IonDesign included scope assessment, gap analysis, POA&amp;amp;M development, and implementation. Experience also includes enterprise-wide NIST 800-171 implementation as ISO/ISSO.&#xA;Whether Level 1 self-attestation or Level 2 preparation, we guide organizations through compliance requirements efficiently.&#xA;Want to see our full process?

      <description>Your infrastructure is the foundation of your compliance posture. We design and build secure CMMC enclaves that isolate CUI from the rest of your network.&#xA;Using Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Ansible), we deploy compliant architectures with proper encryption, access controls, and boundary protection baked in.&#xA;Experience with AWS GovCloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and hybrid environments ensures your data stays safe and your hosting meets FedRAMP requirements.</description>

      <description>Manual compliance is expensive and error-prone. We use DevOps principles to automate your security governance.&#xA;By implementing configuration management and continuous monitoring, we ensure that your systems stay compliant, not just during an audit window.&#xA;We build pipelines that automatically validate security controls, enforce secure baselines, and generate the evidence you need for your System Security Plan (SSP).</description>

      <description>CMMC Compliance for Defense Contractors The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program is mandatory for defense contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). We help organizations achieve and maintain compliance efficiently.&#xA;What is CMMC? CMMC is the Department of Defense&amp;rsquo;s unified cybersecurity standard for the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). It ensures contractors protect sensitive government information by implementing appropriate security controls.&#xA;Three Levels:&#xA;Level 1 - Foundational cybersecurity hygiene (17 practices) Level 2 - Advanced cybersecurity practices aligned with NIST 800-171 (110 practices) Level 3 - Expert-level practices for highly sensitive programs Most contractors need Level 1 or Level 2 certification to continue bidding on DoD contracts.</description>
