<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Do you require long-term contracts?</strong>
No. We work on month-to-month agreements for managed services. Stay because we deliver value, not because you&rsquo;re locked in.</p>
<p><strong>What size businesses do you work with?</strong>
Typically 5-50 employees. Small enough to care about each client, large enough to need proper IT management.</p>
<p><strong>Do you work on-site or remotely?</strong>
Both. Most day-to-day work happens remotely for faster response and lower costs. On-site service available when needed for installations, physical infrastructure, or complex issues.</p>
<p><strong>How quickly do you respond to support requests?</strong>
Managed services clients get priority support with response goals based on issue severity. Critical issues receive immediate attention. Routine requests typically handled within a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>What if we already have some IT infrastructure?</strong>
We work with what you have. We assess your current systems, identify what&rsquo;s working well and what needs attention, and develop a practical path forward.</p>
<p><strong>Can you help with specific projects even if we don&rsquo;t need ongoing support?</strong>
Yes. We handle one-time projects like migrations, upgrades, security improvements, and specific implementations.</p>
